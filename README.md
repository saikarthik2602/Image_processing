The project is to convert a color image to GrayScale image and also to convert a color image to Inverted image.

Before executing the code in your system make sure that you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

The method "inversion" in the code converts a color image to an inverted image and creates a new image in the same folder with prefix "Inverted-".

The method "grayscale" in the code converts a color image to an Grayscale image and creates a new image in the same folder with prefix "GrayScale-".

Before executing the code make sure that you change the respective paths.

Initially before exection of my code,I have 11 different images in the Images Folder after execution,I had 33 images in which 11 are Grayscale images and the other 11 are Inverted images.
