The project is to convert a color image to GrayScale image and also to convert a color image to Inverted image.

Before executing the code in your system make sure that you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

The method "inversion" in the code converts a color image to an inverted image and creates a new image in the same folder with prefix "Inverted-".

The method "grayscale" in the code converts a color image to an Grayscale image and creates a new image in the same folder with prefix "GrayScale-".

Before executing the code make sure that you change the respective paths.

Initially before exection of my code,I have 12 different images in the Images Folder after execution,I had 36 images in which 12 are Grayscale images and the other 12 are Inverted images.

The output images are given in the "png" format but the input images can be in any of the following formats mentioned below :
    
    --> tif
		--> tiff
    --> bmp
    --> jpg
    --> jpeg
    --> gif
    --> png
    --> eps
    --> raw
		--> cr2
    --> nef
    --> orf
    --> sr2
    
The images folder which I have worked upon is uploaded for your reference.
